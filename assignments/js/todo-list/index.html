title: TODO List
---

<p>
  Your task is so write a simple TODO List application. TODO items can be
  added, removed and marked as done.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  A new TODO item is entered in the text box. Pressing Enter adds it to the
  list.
</p>

<p>
  Clicking <code>Delete</code> deletes the corresponding item.
</p>

<p>
  Checking the checkbox causes the item to display differently indicating
  it has been done. Un-checking the checkbox returns the item's display
  back to normal.    
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  The TODO list should work on both small and large displays and should
  adjust it's width according to the size of it's container.
</p>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<p>
  Feel free to enhance your application with nicer styles or improved
  functionality
</p>
