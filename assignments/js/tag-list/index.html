<p>
  A new tag is added by entering it's name in the text box and pressing Enter.

  Tags are listed one after another in the order they were added. 
</p>

<p>
  Each tag has an <code>X</code> that removes the tag. 
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  The tag list should work on both small and large displays and should
  adjust it's width according to the size of it's container.
</p>

  Feel free to enhance your application with nicer styles or improved
  functionality.
