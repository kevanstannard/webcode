title: Movie Publisher
---

<p>
  In this assignment you will display a list of movies that need to be published.
  We assume the publishing step is a time consuming process and they must be
  published one at a time (i.e. synchronous processing).
</p>

<p>
  The assignment should accept an array of movies as it's input.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var movies = [

  {
    name: "The Wizard of Oz",
    year: "1939"
  },

  {
    name: "Citizen Kane",
    year: "1941"
  },

  {
    name: "The Godfather",
    year: "1972"
  },

  {
    name: "The Third Man",
    year: "1949"
  },

  {
    name: "A Hard Day's Night",
    year: "1964"
  }

];
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The movies should be listed on the screen with a <b>Pending</b> status.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  When the <code>Publish</code> button is clicked the publishing process starts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Publish button is disabled</li>
  <li>A progress indicator shows how many movies have been published</li>
  <li>The movie currently being published shows a status of <b>Publishing</b></li>
  <li>When a movie has been published its status changes to <b>Done</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="assignment-image">

</p>

<p>
  When all movies have been published the progress message indicates the
  publishing is complete.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  Use a JavaScript timer to simulate a delay while publishing each movie. 
</p>

<p>
  The application should work on both small and large displays and should
  adjust it's width according to the size of it's container.
</p>


<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<p>
  Feel free to enhance your application with nicer styles or improved
  functionality.
