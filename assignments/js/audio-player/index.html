  Your task is so write a mock audio player that simulates playing a list
  of songs.

  A list of audio tracks should be provided as a JavaScript array.
  The duration is provided in seconds, but we'll just use small durations
  for this assignment.

{% highlight javascript %}
var tracks = [

  {
    name: "Imagine",
    artist: "John Lennon",
    duration: 15
  },

  {
    name: "We are the Champions",
    artist: "Queen",
    duration: 20
  },

  {
    name: "Hey Jude",
    artist: "The Beatles",
    duration: 10
  }

];
{% endhighlight %}

  When the application starts it should immediately start playing the first
  track.
