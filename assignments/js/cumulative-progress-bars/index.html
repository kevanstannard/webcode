</p>

<p>
  The <code>+</code> button increases the percentage by 20.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>-</code> button decreases the percentage by 20.
</p>

<p>
  The Total progress bar shows the combined overall progress of all
  of the progress bars.
</p>

<p>
  Percentages should never go over 100 or below 0.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  The application should be easily configured to show as many progress
  bars as required.
</p>

<p>
  The application should work on both small and large displays and should
  adjust it's width according to the size of it's container.
</p>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<p>
  Feel free to enhance your application with nicer styles or improved
  functionality
